# Number Guessing Game 

In this assignment I created a number guessing game using JavaScript. My goal for this project was to apply JavaScript fundamentals and concepts that I have learned throughout the week. More precisely, 
I applied the use of a while loop to control the flow of the game so that the functions I created would be invoked at the correct time. Along with this, I learned to parse values, mainly Number() so that the value
produced was the correct primitive value I needed for my functions. Finally, I used conditional statements and logical operators to control the outcome of user inputs. 

An interesting functionality I implemented in this game was setting the difficulty of the game so that, depending on the difficulty chose,
users would have a different amount of guesses they were allowed before they lost the game. The way I made this setting work was to 
make each guess a user made an object. Each newly created object was then pushed to an empty array. After this happened, I had a condition 
which ended the game once the array of guesses equaled the number of guesses they were allowed. 

Along with this functionality I tried to implement ES6 syntax, such as string interpolation, const and let.
